\subsection{Approximation Theorems}

The approximation quality of neural networks has been studied extensively in the
literature. Several so called universal approximation theorems have been proven which
show that under certain conditions on the network architecture they approximate any
continuous function arbitrary well.

\cite{Hornik.1991}. Statements like the universal
approximation theorems and the empirical success of networks make them a suitable
surrogate model candidate.
