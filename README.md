### Topics in Econometrics and Statistics

> Summer 2022, Tim Mensinger

This repository contains (source) material for

1. A custom implementation of a vanilla MLP neural network using JAX. The network is
   trained on the MNIST data set to recognize hand-written digits.
1. Two presentations on the theoretical and practical side of neural networks. The
   theoretical version was presented in class.
1. A term paper that analyzes neural networks from an econometric perspective.

## Paper

The tex-files are stored in the folder `[root]/paper` and compiled using (a relatively
fresh install of) latex.

- [ðŸ—Ž Paper](<>)

## Presentation

There is a *theoretical* and a *practical* presentation. You can view them here

- [ðŸ—Ž Theoretical](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/timmens/neural-net/blob/main/presentation/theoretical.html)
- [ðŸ—Ž Practical](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/timmens/neural-net/blob/main/presentation/practical.html)

The source code is stored in the folder `[root]/presentation` and rendered using
[marp](https://marp.app/).

## Code

### Installation

To get started, create and activate the environment with

```bash
$ cd 'into project root'
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate nnet
```

This installs the package dependencies and the project itself. You can then import
functions defined in the repository as

```python
from nnet.network import build_network
from nnet.plotting import plot_examples
```

### Reproduce Paper

### Custom Neural Network Implementation

> **Warning** Jax is not supported on windows.

or you run the notebook locally ---or view it on
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/timmens/neural-net/blob/main/src/nnet/neural_network.ipynb).
